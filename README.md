# My GitHub Project

Welcome to my project! Here, I list suggested topics to learn about C++.

<!--C++_TOPICS-->
- **Project 1: AI-Powered Precision Medicine for Personalized Cancer Treatment**
- 
- **Objective:** Develop an AI system to analyze patient health data and genetic information to tailor cancer treatments for improved outcomes.
- 
- **Data:**
- * Electronic health records (EHRs) containing patient demographics, medical history, and treatment plans
- * Genomic data including DNA sequencing and gene expression profiles
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations in patient data
- * Deep learning models to extract insights from genomic data
- * Natural language processing (NLP) to analyze clinical notes and identify relevant information
- 
- **Project 2: AI-Enabled Early Detection of Sepsis**
- 
- **Objective:** Create an AI system to detect sepsis early and accurately, reducing mortality and morbidity rates.
- 
- **Data:**
- * EHRs containing patient vital signs, laboratory results, and medical events
- * Sensor data from wearable devices such as heart rate monitors and respiratory sensors
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Time series analysis to identify temporal patterns in patient data
- * Deep learning models to learn complex relationships between different data sources
- * Decision tree algorithms to predict the likelihood of sepsis based on the extracted features
