# My GitHub Project

Welcome to my project! Here, I list suggested topics to learn about C++.

<!--C++_TOPICS-->
- **Project 1:** **Predicting Hospital Readmissions**
- 
- **Objective:** Develop an AI model to predict which patients are at risk of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge.
- 
- **Data:**
- * Electronic health records (EHRs) containing patient demographics, medical history, laboratory results, and discharge summaries.
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or random forests.
- * Features extracted from the EHRs, including patient age, comorbidities, length of stay, and discharge medications.
- 
- **Project 2:** **Personalizing Cancer Treatment Plans**
- 
- **Objective:** Develop an AI-driven system that generates personalized treatment plans for cancer patients based on their genetic and clinical data.
- 
- **Data:**
- * Genomic data (e.g., whole-genome sequencing)
- * Clinical data (e.g., tumor size, stage, histology)
- * Treatment response data
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from medical reports.
- * Machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that identify treatment options most likely to be effective for each patient.
- * Data visualization and exploration tools to enable clinicians to understand the model predictions and make informed decisions.
