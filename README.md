# My GitHub Project

Welcome to my project! Here, I list suggested topics to learn about C++.

<!--C++_TOPICS-->
- **Project 1: Early Diagnosis of Sepsis**
- 
- **Objective:** To develop an AI model that can accurately predict sepsis early on, based on patient data.
- 
- **Data:**
- * Electronic health records (EHR) of patients with sepsis
- * Data includes vital signs, laboratory results, medications, and clinical notes
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Train a supervised machine learning model on the EHR data to identify patterns and features associated with sepsis
- * Use feature engineering to extract relevant variables from the EHR data
- * Optimize the model's performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- 
- **Expected Outcome:** An AI model that can predict sepsis with high sensitivity and specificity, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
- 
- **Project 2: Personalized Cancer Treatment Planning**
- 
- **Objective:** To develop an AI system that can generate personalized cancer treatment plans based on the patient's tumor characteristics and clinical history.
- 
- **Data:**
- * Cancer genomic data (DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling)
- * Clinical data (patient demographics, medical history, treatment outcomes)
- 
- **Methods:**
- * Train a machine learning model to predict the response of cancer cells to different treatment regimens based on the genomic and clinical data
- * Use optimization algorithms to generate personalized treatment plans that maximize the predicted probability of a positive outcome
- * Integrate the AI system with a clinical decision support tool to assist oncologists in treatment planning
- 
- **Expected Outcome:** An AI system that can help physicians tailor cancer treatments to each patient's unique biological profile, leading to improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects.
